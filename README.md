# 💊 PumpFun EVM Smart Contract

The **Pump.fun EVM Smart Contract** brings the power of viral, one-click token creation to the **EVM-Compatible blockchain**, mirroring the simplicity and virality of the original **Pump.fun** on Solana. This version is built natively for **Monad's EVM-compatible testnet**, with full support for **Uniswap liquidity migration**, enabling instant tradability in the broader Ethereum ecosystem.

---

## ✨ Key Features

- **Token Creation**  
  Instantly create customizable tokens (name, symbol, total supply) on Monad.

- **Bonding Curve Pricing**  
  Implements a linear bonding curve for fair price discovery, rewarding early buyers.

- **Auto Liquidity Management**  
  Seamlessly manage buys/sells using an embedded bonding curve—no AMM setup required.

- **🔄 Uniswap Migration**  
  Once the liquidity threshold is hit, migrate liquidity to **Uniswap V2/V3** for open DeFi trading.

- **Full Onchain Execution**  
  All logic is executed onchain—including minting, pricing, and migration—for maximum transparency and decentralization.

- **EVM-Compatible**  
  Written in **Solidity**, deployed on Monad, and fully interoperable with Ethereum tooling like **Hardhat**, **Foundry**, and **MetaMask**.

## 🚀 Latest Enhancements

### 🔄 Uniswap Liquidity Migration  
After sufficient buy-in volume is reached, token liquidity is automatically migrated to a Uniswap pool—allowing users to continue trading in the open market with real-time pricing and increased exposure.

### ✅ Token Authority Options  
Smart contract logic supports optional authority revocation or time-bound admin permissions, ensuring flexibility in launch strategy (community-led or project-driven).

### 📊 Real-Time Metrics (Coming Soon)  
Planned dashboard support for token metrics, price charts, migration status, and market depth.

## ⚠️ Notes

- Currently deployed on **Monad Testnet**. Awaiting Monad mainnet release for production launch.
- Bonding curve mechanics mirror Solana Pump.fun’s pricing structure.
- Liquidity migration requires minimum bonding curve volume (configurable via contract params).
